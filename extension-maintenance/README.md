## Netlify maintenance extension

This is a Netlify extension you can add to your Netlify team. If you add and enable it for your team, you can then install it in all your sites.

Once it's installed, this extension allows you to enable or disable "maintenance mode" for your site. When enabled the site will just render a simple page with a message that you can customize.
