## Netlify maintenance extension

This is a Netlify extension you can add to your Netlify team. If you add and enable it for your team, you can then install it in all your sites.

Once it's installed, this extension allows you to enable or disable "maintenance mode" for your site. When enabled the site will just render a simple page with a message that you can customize.

## Installation

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/extension/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/code-jorge/netlify-sites&base=extension-maintenance&integrationName=Maintenance%20Mode&integrationSlug=maintenance-mode&integratonDescription=Enable%20maintenance%20mode%20for%20your%20site&scopes=site:read,site:write,env:read,env:write,env:delete)

Once that's deployed, you need to convert it to an extension by visiting `Extensions > Created by your team` and clicking on the `Create Extension` button.

From there you will be able to transform your existing site to an extension that will be available to all your sites.
