## Product Launch

This very simple site has a form for capturing emails and submitting them 
to **Netlify** using its form detection.

Forms must be enabled in the **Netlify** site settings for this site to work.

Beware that **Netlify Identity** is a paid feature. Some features are available 
in the free tier. Also it has usage limits in the free tier but extensive 
usage can lead to charges.
