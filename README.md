## Netlify Sites

Small sites I've built and that explore **Netlify** features.

- [countdown](./countdown/) - A site that uses `Environment Variables` and `Edge Functions` to create a countdown timer.

- [identity](./identity/) - A site that logs users in using **Netlify Identity**.

- [subscribe](./subscribe/) - A site that captures emails using **Netlify Forms**.

- [jellydonut](./jellydonut/) - A simple jellydonut floating around.

- [detect-ip](./detect-ip/) - A site that detects the IP address of the visitor using an `Edge Function`.

- [sleepy-cat](./sleepy-cat/) - A site that uses **Netlify Images** to optimize an image.
